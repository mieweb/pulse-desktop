# Pulse Desktop

Check out [pulse](https://github.com/mieweb/pulse) to get pulse and this repo together.

**Minimal push-to-hold screen recorder for macOS and Windows**

Push-to-hold screen capture with the simplicity of a walkie-talkie. Press `Cmd+Shift+R` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows), hold to record, release to save. Videos are automatically saved to your Movies folder.

> **üöß Architecture Update**: Migrating from FFmpeg-based transcoding to native OS APIs (ScreenCaptureKit + Desktop Duplication) for better performance and Retina support. See [MIGRATION_NOTES.md](MIGRATION_NOTES.md) for details.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Push-to-hold recording** - Press and hold to record, release to save
- ‚úÖ **Global hotkey** - Works from any application (`Cmd+Shift+R` / `Ctrl+Shift+R`)
- ‚úÖ **Full screen capture** - Records entire display at 30 FPS
- üöß **MP4 video output** - Migrating to native H.264 encoding (hardware accelerated)
- ‚úÖ **Sequential file naming** - `recording-1.mp4`, `recording-2.mp4`, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Automatic folder creation** - Saves to `~/Movies/PushToHold` (macOS) or `~/Videos/PushToHold` (Windows)
- ‚è≥ Microphone audio toggle (coming soon)
- ‚è≥ Region selection with aspect ratio presets (coming soon)

## System Requirements

### macOS

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Deno** - JavaScript/TypeScript runtime ([install](https://deno.com/))
- **Rust** - For Tauri backend ([install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (macOS only)
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```

### Running the App

```bash
# Clone and navigate to the project
cd pulse-desktop

# Run in development mode
deno task tauri dev
```

This will:
1. Start the Vite dev server (React frontend)
2. Compile and run the Rust/Tauri backend
3. Open the desktop application window

### Other Commands

```bash
# Build for production
deno task tauri build

# Run frontend only (UI development)
deno task dev

# Run tests
deno task test
```

## Using Pulse Desktop

1. **Launch the app** - Run `deno task tauri dev`
2. **Create/select a project** - Choose a project name for organizing your recordings

4. **Release to save** - Your recording is automatically saved
5. **Manage clips** - View your timeline, drag to reorder clips, edit labels, or delete

- **Edit labels** - Click on any clip filename to rename
- **Undo/Redo** - Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z for timeline changes

## Development

### Recommended IDE Setup
