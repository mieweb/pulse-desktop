# Pulse Desktop

**Minimal push-to-hold screen recorder for macOS and Windows**

Push-to-hold screen capture with the simplicity of a walkie-talkie. Press `Cmd+Shift+R` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows), hold to record, release to save. Videos are automatically saved to your Movies folder.

> **üöß Architecture Update**: Migrating from FFmpeg-based transcoding to native OS APIs (ScreenCaptureKit + Desktop Duplication) for better performance and Retina support. See [MIGRATION_NOTES.md](MIGRATION_NOTES.md) for details.
